                            A short two page comic made for a Narrative and Technology class. About the protagonist 
                            (unnamed in the piece itself but referred to in my notes as "Nist") meeting with a shadowy
                            figure who claims to have "the truth". Created using Gimp in March 2022.

                            These are the very early sketches of what the comic would be, or at least the very beginning of it. Because of the deadline I only had text to describe what I planned 
                            to make. These sketches of Nist were before I settled on a design, so they look incredibly generic and inconsistent.

                            These are the initial sketches that I of created an actual design for Nist. My design process was initially to create the basic facial structure
                            and create a simple hairstyle, and then modify it to make it disheveled. They were initially intended to be the same character but I liked the left
                            design and decided that they were different, with the name Nick, though that's outside of the scope of this project.

                        An "emoji proposal" made for a Computer Science introductory course, for something about visual representation of something, in this case
                        communication. I made some long spiel about its importance but it's honestly just something I came up with really quickly. 
                        I'm surprised something like this isn't an emoji already... at least I don't think it is, I don't know I don't even use emojis. Created using Gimp in April 2022.

                    <p class="textBlocks right">
                        A visual argument Photoshop (or Gimp-shop I guess) about how capitalism sucks. It's meant to be a kinda over exaggerated representation of my qualms with
                        how the system works. The drawing that's on the board was initially meant to be a placeholder, but I was told that it fit well due to an awful image causing all
                        of the investors to instantly give their money being very fitting, they just love the pain of others (also yes I know they're holding $1 bills shut up). The first impressions made people confused
                        as to what the message is, but I didn't really want to add a bunch of text, so I settled on only adding a simple alliterative caption. Created using Gimp in March 2023.

                        A short rough audio narrative sort of a follow up/reimagining of "Brush with the Void" made for
                        a Digital Media class. The protagonist (once again on unnamed but was called "James Twhith" in my notes)
                        meeting with another shady figure and zany hijinks ensue. Created using Audacity in February 2023. For the sources, click

                        (Yes that is the actual name). A short Twine project made for a Narrative and Technology class. It's a short game about playing as, shocker,
                        a nameless protagonist (this one actually doesn't have a name in my notes, naming them is your job) as they try to escape 
                        a dungeon using the tools around them. The game has a very simple structure as it's mostly focused on the jokey
                        dialogue of the narrator. Created using Twine in March 2022.
