                A short two page comic made for a Narrative and Technology class. About the protagonist 
                (unnamed in the piece itself but reffered to in my notes as "Nist") meeting with a shadowy
                figure who claims to have "the truth". Created using Gimp in March 2022.

            <img src="img/Visual Argument.png" alt="Suffering Sells" width="500">
            <p>
                A visual argument Photoshop (or Gimp-shop I guess) about how capitalism sucks. That's about it.
                Created in March 2023.

                A short rough audio narrative sort of a follow up/reimagining of "Brush with the Void" made for
                a Digital Media class. The protagonist (once again on unnamed but was called "James Twhith" in my notes)
                meeting with another shady figure and zany hijinx ensue. Created in February 2023.

            <p>
                (Yes that is the actual name). A short Twine project made for a Narrative and Technology class. It's a short game about playing as, shocker,
                a nameless protagonist (this one actually is completely nameless, naming them is your job) as they try to escape 
                a dungeon using the tools around them. The game has a very simple structure as it's mostly focused on the jokey
                dialoge of the narrator.
